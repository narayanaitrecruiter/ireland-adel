To deploy the Helm charts using a Jenkins pipeline, you'll need to set up a Jenkins pipeline script (Jenkinsfile). Below is an example Jenkinsfile that demonstrates how to deploy the Helm charts for the Confluent Platform components using Jenkins.

Prerequisites:
Jenkins must have the necessary plugins installed:
Kubernetes plugin
Helm plugin
Git plugin
Jenkins must be configured with a Kubernetes cluster.
Helm must be installed and configured in your Jenkins environment.

Explanation:
Checkout Stage:

This stage checks out the code from your Git repository.
Helm Init Stage:

This stage initializes Helm, adds the Helm repository, and updates the repository index.
Lint Helm Chart Stage:

This stage lints the Helm chart to ensure there are no syntax or configuration issues.
Deploy Helm Chart Stage:

This stage deploys or upgrades the Helm chart in the specified Kubernetes namespace using the helm upgrade --install command.
Verify Deployment Stage:

This stage verifies the deployment by checking the status of the Helm release.
Adding to Jenkins
Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job:

Open Jenkins and create a new Pipeline job.
In the job configuration, set the pipeline script to use the above Jenkinsfile.
Configure Jenkins Credentials:

Ensure that Jenkins has the necessary credentials to access your Git repository and Kubernetes cluster.
You may need to configure Kubernetes credentials in Jenkins using the Kubernetes plugin.
Run the Pipeline:

Save the job configuration and run the pipeline.
Monitor the job to ensure that each stage completes successfully.
Customization
Helm Repository URL:

Update HELM_REPO_URL with the URL of your Helm repository.
Git Repository URL:

Update the Git URL in the Checkout stage to point to your repository.
Namespace:

Ensure the namespace (KUBE_NAMESPACE) matches your Kubernetes namespace.
Helm Chart Values:

Customize the values.yaml file as needed to fit your deployment requirements.
This Jenkins pipeline script provides a robust way to automate the deployment of your Helm charts to a Kubernetes cluster, integrating with your existing CI/CD processes.
